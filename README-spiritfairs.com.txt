Hello!

The content on this website has a Github repo, at:

https://github.com/alexharries/spiritfairs.com

If you will be working on this code, it's entirely up to you how you manage
this project, but one approach might be to fork that repo, at:

https://github.com/alexharries/spiritfairs.com#fork-destination-box

... make your changes to the forked repo, synchronise the changed files up to
this server, and then if you're feeling particularly keen, you can issue a
pull request via Github to have your hard work merged back into the parent
repository.

This way, the next poor developer-type who has to work on this microsite can
get the most up-to-date code as easily as you did.

Or, y'know, you can completely ignore me and do your own thing; I don't mind.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Thanks for your time!
